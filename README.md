<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an in progress python music bot that will stream music onto a group chatting platform known as discord. 
This project was written fully in python and by my self that I will be updating as I go.

Here's why:
* Personal use
* Allows me and my friends to listen to music together
* Many of the popular music bots that work with youtube are being taken down
* Project experience (duh)
* Learning experience

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an guide on how to set up the bot on your local machine.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is a list things you need to make your bot and how to install them.

* [Making a bot, getting its unique token and inviting it to your server.
  Refer to this link (click me) if you don't know how to make a discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)
* After you have your bot created go to your developer portal and go to the bot tab and under the section Privileged Gateway Intents and enable *SERVER MEMBERS INTENT* and *MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT*.
* This git repo has a requirements.txt file becasue the bots uses a fair amount of libaries. If your not a beginner you will know what to do with this file.
* For the beginners I will show you how to manually install all the libaries. 
* Open up your terminal (cmd) and type in these commands:
 
  #### Windows

  ```sh
  pip install yt_dlp
  pip install validators
  pip install discord
  pip install youtube_search
  pip install PyNaCl
  pip install ffmpeg
  ```
  #### linux
  
  ```sh
  pip install yt_dlp
  pip install validators
  pip install discord
  pip install youtube_search
  pip install PyNaCl
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```

### Installation

This is a quick guide on how to get the bot running on your own device. Note that once done these steps
the bot will only run while your pc or laptop is on unless you are using a server to host it.
One more thing as mentioned above it's still a work in progress and does not work perfectly. I am
Aware of most of the bugs and I am updating it as often as I can.

1. Have a bot on discord that is ready to use along with its unique token
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Adib-Nasreddine/Python-Music-Bot
   ```
3. Put in your unique bot token into the python script which will be at the bottom of the code
4. Finally just run the code on your pc or laptop

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The bot has a few commands that are common with any music bot

1. play: This will play a song and it takes youtube links or just a name of a song
  ```sh
  $play <song>
  ```
2. skip: This will skip the current song if there is a song next in queue
  ```sh
  $skip
  ```
3. pause: will pause the music
  ```sh
  $pause
  ```
4. resume: will resume the music
  ```sh
  $resume
  ```
5. stop: will stop the bot (disconnect) and reset the queue
  ```sh
  $stop
  ```
6. queue: will display the song queue
  ```sh
  $queue
  ```
